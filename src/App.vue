<!-- This project was made by Marcos PinzÃ³n as an assignment for OneWater.org.

     It was completed in around 14 hours. No external help was used apart from
     Quasar documentation or google searches for specific language features.
    
     Following the recomentation on Quasar's introductory guide of using Vue Single File 
     Components (SFC) I included HTML, CSS and JS in this file. -->

<template>
  <router-view />
</template>

<script>
import { defineComponent } from 'vue'

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'App'
})
</script>
